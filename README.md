# Gym-Reservation<br><br>
2016.03~2016.05 <br><br>

It is divided into two users, a gym manager and a total of two users, and users send a reservation application including reservation time to the manager who registered the gym, and the manager approves/cancels the reservation.


In renting a gym coat or equipment, customers should call the gym to make a reservation or visit it in person unless they have made a reservation in advance. In some cases, they can't answer the phone at the gym or are already using it when they go in person. Gym managers should answer the phone one by one and use the management ledger or write it on a large board to manage it.<br>
I'll call several gyms in Suwon,<br>
As a result of finding out, many felt lazy and had to write and erase every time. Therefore, to eliminate this inconvenience and hassle, our team uses smartphones that almost everyone has these days to make it easier for managers to manage reservations at the gym and to customers who apply for reservations.<br>
It was developed for the purpose of maximizing convenience. First of all, the criteria for selecting gymnasiums were the Suwon area, and if the application is developed, I think it will be possible to manage and supervise gymnasiums across the country.
